# -Iris-Segmentation-using-Image-processing-in-MATLAB
In this project:
Iris segmentation for different type of test eye images using Matlab 
to write a program that helps us to differentiate between the human 
iris and pupil. 
Any color eye image that is given as input, the current program will output an grayscale image with iris and pupil segmented
